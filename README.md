# Python-Small-Projects

A collection of small Python projects and scripts demonstrating different ideas — good for learning, experimenting, or building on for bigger projects.
For now have pushed 2 of them. File Parser to convert and ini file into csv format.
Second is a small KBC Game which I built while learning loops and functions.
In future will update some other projects as well.
